		/// <para>This method requires a bit of explaination as there's a great deal of misunderstandings. <see cref="Char"/> is a 16-bit integer, yet UNICODE requires at least 21 bits of storage. This is an archaic decision from back in the days of UCS-2. Changing things to update with the times wouldn't be feasible. Because of this, .NET strings sometimes require 2 characters to represent a single codepoint. That means, while in most cases, this operation will return a single character in an array, there are cases where the codepoint exceeds 16-bits and has to be encoded. For that reason, if you're on a new enough runtime, you want to use <see cref="ReadRune(Stream)"/>, which does this same operation but with a type capable of representing the codepoint as a single value.</para>
